# Capital City Game

<p>
The capital city game is a simple Python terminal game that can be played by children and adults. It runs on Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku. This game provides the opportunity to learn about the capitals of the different countries in the world while at the same time having fun. The game can be useful to school children when they are studying geography. Moreover, the capital city game could also inspire the players of the game to travel the world to visit the different capitals, and the countries in which they are located. In addition, the game also helps to expand the general knowledge of the player.
